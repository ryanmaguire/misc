    \textbf{Ryan Maguire}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            Write detailed paper on the new numerical algorithms that have been
            developed over the last few years to carefully and accurately
            process the Cassini radio science data at ultra-high resolutions
            (55 meters).
        \item
            Finish writing \texttt{rss\_ringoccs}, the library of code
            that is used to process the data.
        \item
            Analysis of the waves found in the C-Ring at high resolution.
            Draft a paper on this analysis.
        \item
            Analyze other data sets at high resolutions and report findings.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Dick French}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            Analysis of the waves found in the C-Ring ripples.
        \item
            Study particle size distributions in the rings using the new
            numerical methods.
        \item
            Analyze the F-Ring and the strange ringlet at high resolutions.
        \item
            Make the new high resolution data available on the PDS
            (current data has 1000 meter resolution, significantly worse).
    \end{itemize}
