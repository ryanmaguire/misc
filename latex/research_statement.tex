    \section{Introduction}
        My research interests lie in knot theory, topology, and Lorentz
        geometry, with a particular captivation in numerical methods and the
        design of algorithms. Knot theory is a challenging field when it comes
        to numerical analysis, many of the procedures have aweful complexities.
        For a simple example, it has been known since the 1920s
        (Reidemeister \cite{Reidemeister1927}, Alexander and Briggs
        \cite{AlexanderBriggs1926}) that two knot diagrams are isomorphic as
        knots if and only if there is a finite sequence of Reidemeister moves
        between them.
