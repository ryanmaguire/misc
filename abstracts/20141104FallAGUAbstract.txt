HiT&MIS: Instrumentation for Auroral and Ionospheric Airglow Studies
Hewawasam, K., Maguire, R., Chakrabarti, S., Cook, T., Baumgardner, J. L.

We have developed a high-throughput imaging spectrograph
that uses an echelle grating operating at a high
dispersion order to observe extended sources such as
atmospheric airglow and auroral emissions at high
spectral resolution. Instead of the conventional
single slit this instrument uses four with appropriate
foreoptics to image a long, narrow field of view of
approximately 0.1 Ã— 50 deg. By using interference filters
for order sorting, this instrument can simultaneously
observe multiple spectral features located anywhere in
the visible band (approximately 300 to 1000 nm) at
high resolution. The current implementation images
the scene at 6 wavelengths
(427.8, 486.1, 557.7, 630.0, 656.3 and 777.4 nm), but
the flexibility of the design of the instrument allows
varying the wavelengths of interest with minimal
modifications. We have constructed two spectrographs
to be located at different geomagnetic locations. This
will enable tomography of atmospheric phenomena for
full 3-D rendering of the volume emission. We will
combine HiT&MIS data with data from LITES, GROUP-C
(on ISS) and other ground based sources such as GIRO,
HiTIES, HIRISE and CHIMES along with the 13 all-sky
imagers operated by Boston University to form a
more complete picture of the ionosphere.
