Title:
How to Compute Sine of 10^100
Abstract:
libm, the standard C library for mathematical functions,
requires implementations for the trigonometric functions.
The difficulty of computing the remainder after division
by a transcendental number, like pi, led to early
implementations having poor or completely gibberish results
for large inputs. One infamous example threw an error for
values |x| > 26. Modern implementations can readily handle
values up to 10^308, the maximum for 64-bit floating point
numbers. We'll talk about how these implementations work
and how to correctly compute the sine of large numbers.
