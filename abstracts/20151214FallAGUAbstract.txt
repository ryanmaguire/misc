A High-Throughput and Multi-slit Imaging Spectrograph (HiT&MIS) has been
developed by our group. The spectrograph uses an echelle grating that
operates at high dispersion orders (28-43) such that extended sources
for airglow and auroral emissions can be observed at high resolution
(about 0.02 nm). By using four slits (instead of the conventional one
slit setup), with the appropriate foreoptics it images extended
emissions along a long field of view of about 0.1° × 50°. It observes
spectral regions around six prominent atmospheric emission lines
(HI 656.3 nm, HI 486.1 nm, OI 557.7 nm, OI 630.0 nm, OI 777.4 nm
and N+2 427.8 nm) using order sorting interference filters at the
entrance slits and a filter mosaic on an image plane.

We present observations from the instrument during the June 22, 2015 G4 storm.
OI 557.7 nm (green line) and OI 630.0 nm (red line) showed strong brightness
enhancements that lasted throughout the night from 8 P.M June 22, 2015 to
3 AM June 23,2015 when compared to the same times after the storm had passed.
