Relative Strengths of Knot Invariants by Experiment

Four knot polynomials have been well studied by
topologists, graph theorists, and algebraists alike:
The Alexander, Jones, HOMFLY-PT, and Khovanov polynomials.
It is known that the Khovanov polynomial is "stronger"
than the Jones polynomial and similarly one may state
that HOMFLY-PT is stronger than both the Alexander and
Jones polynomials. No comparison can be made between
the Jones and Alexander polynomials since there are
families of knots with identical Alexander polynomials
but distinct Jones polynomials, and vice-versa, but
experiment tells us the Jones polynomial is stronger,
on average, at distinguishing knots. We have tabulated
the Alexander, Jones, and HOMFLY-PT polynomials for all
knots up to 19 crossings, and the Khovanov polynomial
for up to 17 crossings. Using this we can experiment on the
relative strengths of these knot invariants and generate
statistics on them.
