Title:
Double, double, toil and trouble: The mathematics of double-double arithmetic.
Abstract:
The standard IEEE-754 double precision floating point arithmetic
allows for 52 significant bits, 53 if one includes the implicit
leading bit past the binary point. Translating this to decimal
one can expect between 15 and 16 decimals of accuracy in their
computations. Mathematical computations may need more than
this, say, in the rendering of the Mandelbrot set. Arbitrary
precision arithmetic is dreadfully slow, and quadruple precision
isn't readily available on most common architectures. The solution
is double-double arithmetic. The idea dates back to at least
the 1970s but is still actively researched and experimented with.
In this talk we'll go over the original Dekker algorithms and
discuss the implementation of double-double.
