The linking number (lk) is a well-known invariant
of links dating back to Gauss. This notion has been
generalized to non-zero-homologous (n-1) spheres in the unit
spherical tangent bundle of an n-manifold by the affine linking
number (alk). In 2004 Chernov and Rudyak used this to
determine when points in a manifold are causally related.
We'll discuss expanding this idea to detecting the number
of light-rays between observers in a spacetime.
