Given a finite ordered set (a.k.a. a finite sequence) of distinct points in
the plane, how can one construct a smooth curve through them? What if the curve
is closed? We can construct C^2 curves by using Bezier cubics, but this
requires immense effort specifying all of the control points and lining them up
correctly to ensure there are no dents in the curve. Donald Knuth came up with
one manner of doing this and implemented it in his metafont language, but the
current standard was developed by John Hobby, published in Discrete and
Computational Geometry in 1986. This method produces aesthetically pleasing
results and is now the standard algorithm in many graphics languages like
asympote and metapost, and support is provided for it in tikz and more. We'll
discuss the algorithm and how to make nice mathematical drawings.
